#### Major tasks
    Dealing with missing values
    Dealing with outliers
    Merging the external datasets
    Saving the processed file

### If one or more steps are not applicable to your dataset, add a comment justifying

### Exploratory Data Analysis
#### Load the clean dataset
#### Data Perspective
    One variable
    Multiple Variables
#### Business Perspective
